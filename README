In this project, I have tried to work with sequences positions starting at 1 (not 0 like python).

Some functionnality require Pysam. It should be shipped with the code.
Pysam require cython, zlib ans easy_install (python setup-tools)
Some functions requires biopython. It can be installed (debian based os) using:
sudo apt-get install python-biopython
More info at:
biopython.org

This is still in heavy developpement. New versions avaiblable every week.
